Supported drivers for JDBC and SQLJ
------------------------------------

The DB2 product includes support for two types of JDBC driver architecture.
According to the JDBC specification, there are four types of JDBC driver architectures:

* Type 1 (Wont work for Zenpack. Not supported in DB2)

   Drivers that implement the JDBC API as a mapping to another data access
   API, such as Open Database Connectivity (ODBC). Drivers of this type are
   generally dependent on a native library, which limits their portability.
   The DB2 database system does not provide a type 1 driver.

* Type 2 (Might work, but not portable)

   Drivers that are written partly in the Java programming language and partly
   in native code. The drivers use a native client library specific to the
   data source to which they connect. Because of the native code, their
   portability is limited.

* Type 3 (Standard Choice without the fancy Type 4 options. Use if possible)

   Drivers that use a pure Java client and communicate with a data server
   using a data-server-independent protocol. The data server then communicates
   the client's requests to the data source. 

* Type 4 (Fancy Options: Not needed)

   Drivers that are pure Java and implement the network protocol for a specific
   data source. The client connects directly to the data source.


DB2 vs Oracle

:: 

                         DB2-Oracle Terminology Mapping

   Because Oracle applications can be enabled to work with DB2Â® data servers
   when the DB2 environment is set up appropriately, it is important to
   understand how certain Oracle concepts map to DB2 concepts.

   Table 1 provides a concise summary of commonly used Oracle terms and
   their DB2 equivalents.

Installing DB2 Express on Linux
---------------------------------

* First you must install Linux
* Next install the prerequisites for DB2
* Make sure the client can do X11 Forwarding to your workstation
* Download DB2 Express, extract it in /opt
* SSH into your instance as root, X11 forwarding on
* Run the installer at /opt/expc/db2setup
* Select defaults and make sure to save set in the Response File
* If you can't type into Java, just cut-n-paste passwords 
* Make sure the installer finishes without error
* Save the Response File
* Next time use the Response File to install all
* Once installed, issue "db2sampl" to create a sample db.
  - db2 connect to sample
  - db2 'select * from dept'

Removing DB2 on Linux
------------------------

* Remove the Database Administration Server::

   sudo su - dasusr1 db2admin stop
   /opt/ibm/db2/V10.5/instance/dasdrop dasusr1 

* Remove the DB2 instance(s)::

   sudo su - db2inst1 -c db2stop
   /opt/ibm/db2/V10.5/instance/db2ilist
   /opt/ibm/db2/V10.5/instance/db2idrop db2inst1
   /opt/ibm/db2/V10.5/instance/db2ilist

* Remove the software installation::

   /opt/ibm/db2/V10.5/install/db2_deinstall -a

* Remote the user accounts too::

   userdel -r db2inst1
   userdel -r dasusr1
   userdel -r db2fenc1
